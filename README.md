Thesis to obtain the degree of BSc in Actuarial Science, received honours. This work explored the Generalized Extreme Values approach, combined with the method of Profile Likelihood, to analyze the distribution of an economic index called REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate). The focus was to understand whether the distribution of this index had long tails, and so could potentially bring catastrophic consequences due to its fluctuations. It was concluded that it had light tails, and that there was an evident breakpoint during a time in which new policies regarding inflation were implemented.
